What we want to show in the presentation: 
1. WHY steady state is important 
HOW : example of the Sodium-Potassium pump

2. HOW can we derive the solution of the steady state analytically? 
-- dynamic mass-balance equations setted to zero
-- time course simulation with time goes to infinity

3. HOW can we perform the SS state calculations numerically in silico?
WHY numrically? faster/ too complicated to calculate analytically

-- time course simulation for a long time 
-- Numerical methods of calculating roots : e.g. Newton method 
-- Intuition
-- Extension to many reactions
-- Detour: Jakobian matrix 
-- Restrictions/ disadvantages/ alternative methods 

4. HOW Tellurium computes it

5. WHICH SS do exist ? 
Stable/unstable steady state
proof 

6. HOW can we explore our model, given the SS? 
Perturbations 
Sensitivity analysis



Question: 
1. Conserved cycles : how can we reduce matrix and get the differential equations we got? 
2. Stable/unstable steady state: why it makes sense for the prediction? There is no perturbations during the simulation. 

Improvements : 
slide 6: delete brackets 
Where is tellurium ss.evaluate slide?
